# Long-term Memory

**What this is:** Harvest's learning log - where it tracks what works, what fails, and patterns it discovers while hunting.

**Why it matters:** This is how Harvest gets smarter over time. It remembers which strategies are profitable, which protocols are reliable, and which opportunities to avoid.

**How it works:** After every action, Harvest logs the result here. Over time, it builds a knowledge base of what makes money and what doesn't. This memory improves decision-making.

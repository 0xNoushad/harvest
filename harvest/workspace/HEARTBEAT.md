# Heartbeat Tasks

**What this is:** Harvest's recurring scan checklist - tasks it performs every 5 minutes during the hunt cycle.

**Why it matters:** This is how you tell Harvest what to monitor and when to take action. Want it to check for new airdrops? Monitor NFT floors? Rebalance positions? Add it here.

**How it works:** Every 5 minutes, Harvest wakes up, scans these tasks, and executes the most profitable opportunities. This is the agent's hunting routine.
